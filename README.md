# motivationProject

The Motivation Project focuses on creating a webpage that will throw a lot of motivation your way whenever you ask for it. My goal is to combine mental health and tech and construct integrated tools that will promote self-awareness and help keep people happy/sane. It is not your usual GitHub Project but it's just a tiny something that I've been working on.
